Forgot to write the inital README text. Making good progress with the calculator with some minor help from the discord. Calculator should take two numbers and either add, subtract, multiply, or divide them and display a result on screen.

Calculator consists of 4 operations; Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divison. The calculator takes multiple operations at a time and you cannot divide by zero. There are no decimal points. There is also no remainder function at the moment. These will be added at a later date as well as styling the calculator.
